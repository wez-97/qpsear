# Overview
  
This vignette demonstrates how to calculate ΔCt, ΔΔCt, and relative expression values  
using qPCR data processed with `quickpcr`.  
You will learn how to transform long-form data into wide-form,  
then compute normalized and relative quantification for your genes of interest.

# Prerequisites

```r
library(quickpcr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

# Arguments

- `wide`  
  Wide-format data frame, typically generated from long-form qPCR data using `pivot_wider`.

- `housekeeping`  
  String. Name of the housekeeping gene column (e.g., `"GAPDH", "18S`).

- `ref_sample`  
  String. The value in the `sample` column to be used as the reference sample.

- `target_genes`  
  Character vector of gene columns to compute ΔCt, ΔΔCt, and relative expression.

# Basic Usage

```r
# 1. Remove any NA targets before wide-format conversion
qc1_clean <- qc1 %>% dplyr::filter(!is.na(target))

# 2. Convert to wide format
wide_qpcr <- qc1_clean %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    id_cols    = c(sample, `Cell Name`, Treatment, Day, experiment),
    names_from = target,
    values_from = ct
  )

# 3. Calculate expression metrics
housekeeping  <- "GAPDH"
ref_sample    <- "No.4_None_D0"  # Replace with your actual reference sample
target_genes  <- c("FABP4", "LEPTIN", "UCP1") # Add all target genes you want

wide_with_exp <- calc_ct_values(
  wide          = wide_qpcr,
  housekeeping  = housekeeping,
  ref_sample    = ref_sample,
  target_genes  = target_genes
)
```

# Returned Result

The returned data frame contains:

- All original columns (e.g., `sample`, `Cell Name`, `Treatment`, etc.)
- One column per gene (e.g., `FABP4`, `GAPDH`, ...)
- For each `target_genes`, the following new columns:
    - `delta_ct_{gene}`: ΔCt value (gene - housekeeping)
    - `delta_dct_{gene}`: ΔΔCt value, normalized to the reference sample
    - `rel_exp_{gene}`: Relative expression, calculated as 2^-ΔΔCt

You can use this data for plotting, statistical analysis, or reporting gene expression changes.
